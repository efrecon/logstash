# logstash

This contains a modified version of the logstash component described
as part of the [good tutorial][1] from Evan Hazlett so that it will
work properly when combined with [logspout][2].  Basically, the
configuration is merged using [these date modifications][3].  To use
it, follow the original tutorial.
